COMPUTATIONAL - ALGORITHMICALLY - A computational mode of thinking means that everything can be viewed as a math problem
involving numbers and formulas.

computers can PERFORM CALCULATIONS and REMEMBER THINGS, know also LIMITS OF COMPUTATION

DECLARATIVE KNOWLEDGE - refers to statements of fact.
IMPERATIVE KNOWLEDGE -  refers to 'how to' methods.

sequence of steps + flow of control  + when to stop = ALGORITHMS

in some languages it's gonna be easier to do some kinds of things than others
any thing you can compute in one language, you can compute in any other language - turing complete

PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES - provides a set of primitive operations - expressions - complex but legal combinations of primitives

means of ABSTRACTION -  a way of taking some complex expression and treat it as a primitive
first level of abstraction - giving names to things

everything in python is an object. objects have a type.
objects are scalar(cannot be subdivided), non-scalar(have internal structure that can be accessed)

SCALAR OBJECTS in python - int - float - bool - NoneType

operator precedence in python

ability to make decisions based on tests

EXTENSION - If you need a critical piece of code to run very fast or want to have some piece of algorithm not to be open,
you can code that part of your program in C or C++ and then use it from your Python program.

python refers to anything used in the program as an object.

white space is important in python. This means that statements which go together must have the same indentation.

Functions are reusable pieces of programs. They allow you to give a name to a block of statements,
allowing you to run that block using the specified name anywhere in your program and any number of times.


A list is an example of usage of objects and classes. When we use a variable i and assign a value to it,
say integer 5 to it, you can think of it as creating an object (i.e. instance) i of class (i.e. type) int.

STANDARD LIBRARY - contain a huge number of modules
sys module - system specific functionality
logging module - store debugging messages or important messages

you can embedd python with c/c++ programs
